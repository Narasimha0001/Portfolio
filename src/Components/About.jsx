      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I’m <strong>Mudhena Narasimha Rao</strong>, a Full Stack Developer passionate about building scalable and user-friendly web applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started my development journey with a fascination for how websites work — which quickly evolved into hands-on learning and building.
        I’ve mastered both frontend and backend technologies including <strong>Core & Advanced Java</strong> (JDBC, Servlets, JSP), <strong>Spring Boot</strong>,
        <strong>Hibernate</strong>, <strong>Python</strong> with <strong>Django</strong>, and relational databases like <strong>MySQL</strong> and <strong>MS SQL Server</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I love solving logical problems, collaborating on team projects, and keeping code clean and maintainable.
        Whether it’s a business application or a passion project, I enjoy bringing ideas to life with tech.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring Indian mythology, learning new tools, and contributing to open-source communities.
